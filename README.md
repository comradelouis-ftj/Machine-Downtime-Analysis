# Machine-Downtime-Analysis
---
This project aims to analyze patterns in machine downtime, as well as to create a model which is able to predict whether or not a machine would be down based on certain variables. Based on the results of both the analysis and the model, a conclusion would be made which includes the recommendations that could be considered in order to deal with machine downtime. The dataset that would be used can be found below:
